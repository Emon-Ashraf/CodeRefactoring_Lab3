Refactored Primitive Obsession in Wallet.AddIncome and AddExpense

Flaw Type: Primitive Obsession

Description: Previously, Wallet methods used raw `int` and `double` values for transaction types and money. This made the code unclear and error-prone.

Refactoring: Replaced primitive types with enums (IncomeType, ExpenseType) and a domain object (Money).

Why: Improves clarity, type safety, and better represents domain concepts.

Conclusion: Strengthens code readability, prevents invalid inputs, and supports richer domain modeling.
